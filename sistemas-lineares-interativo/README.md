 - **How to install?**
Python come with a lot of resources and pre-made functions, but we need to install some additional libraries with their own functions.
In this particular case, we'll need [Numpy]([https://scipy.org/install.html](https://scipy.org/install.html))
On Linux-Based systems, execute the following command on the 
Terminal:
```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
```

-  **How to use?**
The easiest way to run the app is: copy all the code from the .py file and execute it.
But here's a complete tutorial:

1. Copy/Clone this repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/kammradt/sistemas-lineares.py
```
2. Enter the directory you just copied: (This is not the file yet, just a folder)
```
cd sistemas-lineares-interativo
```
3. Run the app
```
python linear.py
```
